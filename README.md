# Lodestar
ROS, but for business logic

# Why?
After wondering about how robotics systems are made (considering how well-integrated the hardware needs to be) i met ROS, fell in love, and felt very sad that i wouldn't get to roll my own distributed system framework. After some time, i noticed that if i wanted to make moderate to high complexity systems that integrate a lot of "nodes" (be them apis/data sources, clients/data sinks, transactions/services) in any of my personal projects i would either go through the kitchen and back to wrangle through eventual spaghetti code or feel the wrath of overhead as i prevent myself from making the mistakes of a free dandy programmer working on a personal project.

Then it hit me.
"Making writing systems of interconected components actually doable and enjoyable for some" is basically the unsaid mission statement of ROS.
But ROS isn't made to interconnect the business logic of your average system, it's made to connect the points that make your robot go vroom vroom.
And here we are.

# How?
I don't know (yet), but i really REALLY want to write a framework for doing something like that. So that's what i'm (hopefully) going to do.
